mlsecproject.org-content
========================

Staging area for content to be added to mlsecproject.org

# How to contribute

Please add the content and blog posts as [Github-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), and we will
do our best to translate it to what our current CMS is able to handle.

All content and code committed here is licensed GPL Affero v3 and will be released
on the [mlsecproject.org](https://mlsecproject.org) website, even though this
is a Private repository.

Having a Private repository gives us some more room to breathe and edit these
posts and new pages without the judging eyes of the community. Well, at least
until we get our :shit: together :grinning:

I propose a simple directory structure, such as (bow before the ASCII):
```
  |__ posts
  |     |__ 2015
  |          |__ drafts
  |          |   |__ 2015-XX-XX_post_title_still_editing.md
  |          |
  |          |__ 01
  |          |   |__ 2015-01-05_happy_holidays_from_MLSec_Project.md
  |          |...
  |
  |__ sections
        |__ secrepo
              |...
```

Also, don't commit straight to `master`. It's rude.
