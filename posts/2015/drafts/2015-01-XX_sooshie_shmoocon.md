#ShmooCon Recap

![ShmooCon Header](shmooheader.jpg =500x100)

While I'm a relative ShmooNoob, ShmooCon has has quickly become one of my favorite cons to attend. The quality of the talks is generally pretty high, the community is really engaged, and the con itself is always well organized. This year proved no different, so I'm left to talk about my impressions of some of the talks I was lucky enough to see.

I was impressed with the con's dedication to talks involving Data Analysis, I caught six of them: Cockroach Analysis: A Statistical Analysis of the Flash and Java Files that Infest the Internet, Practical Machine Learning for Network Security, Manually Searching Advisories and Blogs for Threat Data--"Who's Got Time for That?", White is the New Black: Why White Data Really Matters, Infrastructure Tracking with Passive Monitoring and Active Probing, and The Dark Art of Data Visualization. I also caught a few non-Data Analysis related talks, but I'm going to be focusing on the six above. Overall the talks mentioned above were really good, each seemed to focus on a specific area of "Data Science" and at varying technical levels. Only one stuck out as confusing. However, this post will only deal with the positives of each talk.

Let's dig into [Cockroach Analysis](https://archive.org/download/shmoocon-2015-videos-playlist/Cockroach%20Analysis%20%5BSC2015%5D.mp4). Full disclosure, [Dorsey](http://www.twitter.com/trogdorsey) is a good friend of mine and former collegue. In this talk Dorsey examined Java Class and SWF files. A good overview of the file format was provided, and from the information available in the file format he constructed various features. He also had some creative ideas with regards to feature generation. Given some sparse features of the files, how can features be engineered to help describe the file. Several classifiers were also created using Random Forest, and then used to examine over 300k files. The classifiers got pretty good results and really demonstrate how you can use these types of exercises to help find net-new "interesting" files in your environment. My favorite part of the presentation? [Code](https://github.com/ClickSecurity/data_hacking/tree/master/java_classification) and [examples](https://github.com/ClickSecurity/data_hacking/tree/master/swf_classification) were released.

Next up: [Practical Machine Learning](https://archive.org/download/shmoocon-2015-videos-playlist/Practical%20Machine%20Learning%20for%20Network%20Security%20%5BSC2015%5D.mp4). This was a great high-level talk. Terry did a really nice job summing up some things that are possible with machine learning as well as the different applications of supervised vs. unsupervised learning. A couple of case stuides were covered: [DGA detection](https://www.damballa.com/downloads/r_pubs/RN_DGAs-and-Cyber-Criminals-A-Case-Study.pdf) and [Command and Control detection](https://www.damballa.com/downloads/a_pubs/Damballa_ExecScent.pdf) as well as how Machine Learning was able to lead to successes in those scenarios. A refreshing part of Terry's talk was also some of the pitfalls and gotchas involved in Machine Learning. No code was released, but the two presentations linked were mentioned (hopefully I linked the correct ones).

[Manually Searching Advisories and Blogs for Threat Data--"Who's Got Time for That?"](https://archive.org/download/shmoocon-2015-videos-playlist/Manually%20Searching%20Advisories%20and%20Blogs%20for%20Threat%20Data%20%5BSC2015%5D.mp4) was awesome and personally disappointing. Both Elvis and Shimon did a fantastic job. They developed a really interesting system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to digest various threat reports and programmatically extract IOCs, context, mitigations, etc... from them. These guys set up a slick system, trained NLP models, used various ways to score what they pulled out from documents, and then skinned the entire thing in what seemed to be a pretty easy to use web site. Then, the part that made me sad, no code was released. However, I was super jazzed about them talking about using NLP this way and how you could develop your own solution. We'll call it even for now. *cough* Release the project *cough*

The next talk, [White is the New Black](https://archive.org/download/shmoocon-2015-videos-playlist/White%20is%20the%20New%20Black%20%5BSC2015%5D.mp4), tackles the greatest hurdle when doing any type of Data Analysis and Machine Learning. How do you get good labeled data as input for any models you're building? Irena spoke about a methodology developed at Check Point in order to help them gather known White (non-malicious) data as well as how they were able to increase confidence in Black (malicious) data as well. It's great to get exposed to others methodologies. Not only does it afford us an opportunity to learn as a community, but it gives us insight into how much others are following a scientific process.

[Infrastructure Tracking](https://archive.org/download/shmoocon-2015-videos-playlist/Infrastructure%20Tracking%20%5BSC2015%5D.mp4) with [Passive Monitoring and Active Probing](http://www.slideshare.net/OpenDNS/shmoocon-2015-presentation) was another end-to-end coverage of the process of collecting data, through analysis, and onto action. Various methods of data gathering and and augmentation were covered as they related to Malware infrastructure. One of my favorite parts about it was they covered tying file and network data together to build actionable information and output. [Anthony](http://www.twitter.com/anthonykasza) and [Dhia](http://www.twitter.com/dhialite) also presented case studies on a Zbot proxy network as well as GameOver Zeus. One of the more accessible points of this talk was how you could leverage their techniques and code even if you don't have the massive amounts of data that OpenDNS has. Now get out there and get [tracking](https://github.com/anthonykasza/snapshooter)!

The last talk I saw was [The Dark Art of Data Visualization](https://archive.org/download/shmoocon-2015-videos-playlist/Dark%20Art%20of%20Data%20Visualization%20%5BSC2015%5D.mp4). This presentation covered a couple of different visualization programs that would display data in real-time (vs. being a static graph). David has been visualizing network within ShmooCon Labs, and covered his use of glTail and Skyrails. Some [code](https://github.com/RITHoneynet/DataVisualization) was also released so you can use either of these tools to view Bro log data in a new/different way.

Overall it was a great conference, and as long as I'm able to win the F5 race, or present I plan on going. Worst case I watch the talks live via streaming (a completely acceptable worst case). Thanks again to the organizers and staff for putting on a great conference, and paying attention to the important, and increasing, part Data Analysis plays in the Information Security Industry.

P.S. I didn't say "Cyber" once... damn!
