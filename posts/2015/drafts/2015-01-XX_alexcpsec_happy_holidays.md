Happy Holidays from MLSec Project!

Now that the holidays passed and everyone is slowly getting back to work (including yours truly), I think it would be a good time to update you in what the MLSec Project have been up to these last few months of 2014.

We have been very hard at work since summer, and a lot have been going on under the hood here:

- Updates and improvements to our [open source projects](https://github.com/mlsecproject). Both [Combine and TIQ-test](https://www.mlsecproject.org/blog/2014/08/12/open-source-tools-release-combine-and-tiq-test/) are being used several individuals and organizations and they have been helping shape and implement the improvements they need.

- We have created a [community and a discussion group](https://www.mlsecproject.org/blog/2014/08/27/turn-down-math-introducing-mlsec-project-discussion-group/) for open-source contributors of MLSec Project and people that have had experience with data science and machine learning on information security.

I have also been delivering updated versions of the talks on several venues around the US (HushCon, Siracon, and as a guest to organizations) to help our industry be more familiar with data analysis and machine learning.

I believe that a lot of the improvement we will be seeing in the coming years will come from data-driven techniques, and it is very important for us as a community to be able to tell apart what is helpful and what is not. If only not to waste any more time and money on it.

# Looking forward

While Niddel focuses on the products and the commercial aspects of it, the project will be refocused on this community aspect...
